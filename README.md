# Next-Word-Prediction

his project implements a next word prediction system using Python, leveraging text processing techniques and machine learning. The goal is to create a model that can predict the next word in a sequence of text based on the context provided.

### Overview
Next word prediction is a natural language processing (NLP) task where given a sequence of words, the model predicts the most likely word that follows. This project uses a dataset of text sequences to train a probabilistic model capable of generating likely next words.

### Features
Text Preprocessing: The project preprocesses raw text data using regular expressions (re library) to clean and tokenize the text.

Data Preparation: Utilizes numpy and pandas for efficient data manipulation and transformation, preparing the data into a suitable format for model training.

Model Training: Implements a sequence prediction model using statistical methods or machine learning algorithms.

Evaluation: Evaluates the trained model using metrics such as accuracy or perplexity to assess its performance in predicting the next word.

### Usage
Data Preprocessing:

Customize preprocess.py to clean and tokenize the text data according to your requirements.
Model Training:

Modify train.py to implement a suitable model architecture for next word prediction.
Evaluation:

Use evaluate.py to evaluate the model's performance and generate predictions.
Visualization:

Explore Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for visualizing data and analyzing model behavior.
Dataset
The project can use any text corpus for training and testing. Sample datasets can be provided within the data/ directory or referenced from external sources.

### Technologies Used
Python
re (regular expressions)
numpy
pandas
tqdm (for progress bars and monitoring)
